          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Age and Income</h2>
          <p>
            Clicking various variables allows the comparison of relationships between them. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The following relationships seem to be indicated by the data. <br>
            
            Unsurprisingly, there seems to be a positive correlation between the percent in poverty and those lacking health care. 
            Southern states tend to have the highest rates of poverty and less healthcare coverage.<br>
                         
            Similarly, there appears to be a negative correlation between those lacking Healthcare and Household Income.<br>
             
            Smoking has a positive correlation with poverty and a negative correlation with household income.<br>
              
            Obesity also has a positive correlation with poverty and a negative correlation with household income.<br>
